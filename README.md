## Problem Statement
How might we help Seattle's trans and LGBTQ+ community gain greater access to community-circulated clothing so that more gender-affirming clothing is redistributed to people in need rather than wasted?

## Problem Background
---
### Context
*Why does this problem matter? What is the need not being met? What is the impact of inaction?*

**The Problem**

Transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people often feel disconnected from or uncomfortable with their own bodies. Clothing is a way to reclaim such and express themselves authentically. Body reclamation through identity-affirming clothing is critically important to this underserved community because it has been historically, and even is currently, subject to alarming levels of ridicule, discrimination, and violence (Stotzer, 2009).

**The Need**

Clothing and gender-affirming items are expensive, and the entire shopping process is designed for cisgender bodies and people. From the traditionally gendered clothing cut and sizing system to the stigma against gender non-conformity, trans+ people undergo significant distress and even safety risks when trying to obtain clothing that makes them feel good. And for younger LGBTQ people, they often cannot rely on the support of their family to help them overcome these barriers because they may not feel ready or safe to be openly LGBTQ at home. For a community whose well-being is so intertwined with freedom of expression and exploration of identity, this is devastating.

Especially for LGBTQ people, community uplifts community. The small but hardy trans+ and queer community has a deep well of potential to help each other, particularly on a local level. An older trans man post-top surgery no longer needs his chest binder and could give it to a nearby younger transmasculine person struggling to afford one. This same transmasculine person may no longer need their feminine clothing, which could be donated to a trans girl trying to feminize her wardrobe. This trans girl could give her old masculine wardrobe to a gender-questioning person who wants to experiment with expression.

Although LGBTQ clothing exchange events and resources exist, not everyone has the convenience or safety to take advantage of them. They may not even be aware of these since they often aren't well-publicized due to lack of resources.

**The Impact**

The consequence of inaction is that individuals in the trans+ community continue to struggle alone when they have the potential to help each other.

### Information Problem
*What aspects of the problem can we solve through an information solution?*

**Connecting More People**

Using an online web application connects a much greater range people in the local community who could mutually benefit each other. This creates a bigger pool of clothing that people can give and take from.

**Browsing Clothing**

Large amounts of clothing information can be stored and organized into a browsable format, which people can search and filter to tailor to their specific needs.

**Accessibility & Flexibility**

People can give OR get clothing depending on their current situation. Not only that, but people can also post at ANY time. This could fill in the gaps of local clothing exchanges events, which happen quite infrequently.

**Privacy & Safety**

Online shopping can be more discrete than in-person since it cuts out most social interaction. Our priority as product designers will be to ensure the protection of our users' data privacy.
